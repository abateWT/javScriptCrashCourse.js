    <p>Ethiopia's coffee ceremony is an integral part of their social and cultural life. An invitation to attend a coffee ceremony is considered a mark of friendship or respect and is an excellent example of Ethiopian hospitality.</p>

    <p>Coffee is taken with plenty of sugar (or in the countryside, salt) but no milk and is generally accompanied by lavish praise <em> <b> ghrteyt ieuhouq bfbubpgupiefb b hpqv </em> </b> for its flavour and skilful preparation. Often it is complemented by a traditional snack food, such as popcorn,peanuts or cooked barley. In most parts of Ethiopia, the coffee ceremony takes place three times a day - in the morning,at noon and in the evening.</p>

    <p>The best Ethiopian coffee may be compared with the finest coffee in the world, and premium washed Arabica beans fetch some of the highest prices on the world market. In a world where time has long become a commodity, <mark> <u> the Ethiopian coffee ceremony takes us back to a time when value was given to conversation and human relations. Perhaps an ancient
    proverb best describes the place of coffee in Ethiopian life,</u> </mark> "Buna dabo naw", which when translated means "Coffee is our bread!"</p>
